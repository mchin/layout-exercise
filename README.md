# layout-exercise

This repo contains a simple HTML file and CSS file. 

All coded from scratch with some syntax help from Stack Overflow. 

This is my attempt at interpreting a screenshot given for a layout exercise. I tried my best to replicate the page. The responsiveness is minimal as I just made it so all elements were viewable on the screen for phones and tablets. Not the prettiest styled. Thank you for your time and consideration.
